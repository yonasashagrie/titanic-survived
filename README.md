# titanic-survived
This repository contains a simple script for predicting survival on the Titanic using logistic regression. The dataset includes both training (train.csv) and test (test.csv) datasets.

## Description
The script (intro.ipynb) performs the following steps:

**Reads the training and test datasets using pandas.
**Cleans the datasets by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
** Converts categorical variables into numeric representations.
*Splits the training dataset into training and validation sets.
*Trains a logistic regression model on the training set.
*Evaluates the model's accuracy on the validation set.
*Generates predictions for the test set.
*Creates a submission file (submission.csv) with PassengerId and predicted survival status.


Feel free to modify the script or use it as a starting point for more advanced Titanic survival prediction models. If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Happy coding!
